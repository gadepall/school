. The length of the plot (in metres) is one more than twice its breadth. We need to find the length and breadth of the plot.
\item The product of two consecutive positive integers is 306. We need to find the integers.
\item Rohan’s mother is 26 years older than him. The product of their ages (in years) 3 years from now will be 360. We would like to find Rohan’s present age.
\item A train travels a distance of 480 km at a uniform speed. If the speed had been 8 km/h less, then it would have taken 3 hours more to cover the same distance. We need to find the speed of the train.
\item Find two numbers whose sum is 27 and product is 182. 
\item  Find two consecutive positive integers, sum of whose squares is 365.
