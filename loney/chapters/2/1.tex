\item The coordinates of the vertices of a triangle are $(x_1,y_1)$, $(x_2,y_2)$ and $(x_3,y_3)$. The line joining the first two is divided in the ratio $l:k$, and the line joining his point of division to the opposite angular point is then divided in the ratio  $m:k+l$. Find the coordinates of the latter point of section.
