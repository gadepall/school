\item Consider an acute triangle ABC and let P be an interior point of ABC. Suppose the lines BP and CP, when produced, meet AC and AB in E and F respectively. Let D be the point where AP intersects the line segment EF and K be the foot of perpendicular from D on to BC. Show that DK bisects $\angle$ EKF.

\item Let ABC be a triangle with sides a,b,c. Consider a triangle $A_1B_1C_1$ with sides equal to $a + \frac{b}{2}$, $b + \frac{c}{2}$, $c + \frac{a}{2}$. Show that
\begin{align*}
[A_1B_1C_1] \geq \frac{9}{4}[ABC],
\end{align*}
where [XYZ] denotes the area of the triangle XYZ.
