\item Let ABC be triangle in which AB = AC. Suppose the orthocentre of the triangle lies on the incircle. Find the ratio $\frac{AB}{BC}$.

\item Let ABC be a right-angled triangle with $\angle$B = $90^{o}$. Let D be a point on AC
such that the inradii of the triangles ABD and CBD are equal. If this common
value is $r_0$ and if r is the inradius of triangle ABC, prove that
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{r^{'}} = \frac{1}{r} + \frac{1}{BD} 
\end{align*}
