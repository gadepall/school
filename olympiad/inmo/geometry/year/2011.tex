\item Let ABCD be a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle. Let E, F, G, H be the midpoints of the arcs AB, BC, CD, DA of the circle. Suppose AC.BD = EG.FH. Prove that AC, BD, EG, FH are concurrent.

\item Let D,E,F be points on the sides BC, CA, AB respectively of a triangle ABC such that BD = CE = AF and
 $\angle$BDF = $\angle$CED = $\angle$AFE. Prove that ABC is equilateral.
