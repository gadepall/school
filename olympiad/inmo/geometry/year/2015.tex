\item Let ABC be a right-angled triangle with $angle$B = $90^{o}$. Let BD be the altitude from B on to AC. Let P, Q and I be the incentres of triangles ABD, CBD and ABC respectively. Show that the circumcentre of of the triangle PIQ lies on the hypotenuse AC.

\item Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral. Let the diagonals AC and BD intersect in P . Let PE, PF, PG and PH be the altitudes from P on to the sides AB, BC, CD and DA respectively. Show that ABCD has an incircle if and only if
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{PE} + \frac{1}{PG} = \frac{1}{PF} + \frac{1}{PH}
\end{align*}
