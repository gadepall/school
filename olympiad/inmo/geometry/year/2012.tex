\item Let ABC an acute-angled triangle and let D,E,F be points on BC, CA, AB respectively such that AD is the median, BE is the internal angle bisector and CF is the altitude. Suppose $\angle$FDE = $\angle$C, $\angle$DEF = $\angle$A and $\angle$EFD = $\angle$B.Prove that ABC is equilateral.

\item Let ABC be a triangle. An interior point P of ABC is said to be good if we can find exactly 27 rays emanating from P intersecting the sides of the triangle ABC such that the triangle is divided by these rays into 27 smaller triangles of equal area. Determine the number of good points for a given triangle ABC.

\item Let ABCD be a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle. Suppose AB = $\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}$ and AB subtends $135^{o}$ at the centre of the circle. Find the maximum possible area of ABCD.
