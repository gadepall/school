\item Consider a convex quadrilateral ABCD, in which K,L,M,N are the midpoints of the BC, CD, DA respectively. Suppose
\begin{enumerate}
\item BD bisects KM at Q;
\item QA = QB = QC = QD; and
\item LK/LM = CD/CB
\end{enumerate}
Prove that ABCD is a square.

\item Let R denotes the circum radius of a triangle ABC; a,b,c its sides BC, CA, AB; and $r_a$ exradii opposite A,B,C. If $2R \leq r_a$, Prove that 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $a > b$ and $a > c$
\item $2R > r_b$ and $2R > r_c$
\end{enumerate}
