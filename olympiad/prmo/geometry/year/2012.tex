\item In $\Delta ABC$, we have AC = BC = 7 and AB = 2. Suppose that D is a point on line AB such that B lies between A and D and CD = 8. What is the length of the segment BD?

\item In rectangle ABCD, AB = 5 and BC = 3. Points F and G are on line segment CD so that DF = 1 and GC = 2. Lines AF and BG intersect at E. What is the area of $\Delta AEB$.

\item ABCD is a square and AB = 1. Equilateral triangles AYB and  CXD are drawn such that X and Y are inside the square. What is the length of XY?

\item Let O and I are the circumcentre and incentre of $\Delta ABC$ respectively. Suppose O lies in the interior of 
$\Delta ABC$ and I lies on the circle passing through B, O and C. What is the magnitude of $\angle BAC$ in degrees?

\item PS is a line segment of length 4 and O is the midpoint of PS. A semicircular arc is drawn with PS as diameter. Let X be the midpoint of this arc. Q and R are points on the arc PXS such that QR is parallel to PS and the semicircular arc drawn with QR as diameter is tangent to PS. What is the area of the region QXROQ bounded by the two semicircular arcs?
